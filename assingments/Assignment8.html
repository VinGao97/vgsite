          <h1>Proposal</h1>
          <p> For this assignment i would want to explore my daily life quarantined. Some of the things i do everyday and the things i cant do due to COVID-19. One of the biggest factors that change my system is the virus due to being limited to being home all day. Some of the activities that i do are affected by my family like doing errands around the house, eating or cooking. Another is classes giving assignments and giving time for classes.
            Due to the limited activities i am allowed to do at home, these factors are very limiting in what they affect in my daily life. Some of these factors i have no control over, like family but more than 90% of the activities i do is my control.
          </p>
          <h1>Readings</h1>
          <h3>Rehtoric of video games</h3>
          <p>The message behind animal crossing is not explicit. The simulation of managing a small village and the over economy of debt making banks rich is one that i did not think of when thinking about animal crossing. It all became apparent when the author talks about it in its entirety. The whole reading became very political and economical that i, personally, find it very boring to read through. Half way throught i eventually mindlessly read through a little more before i had to stop. Overall the idea of simulation in games was the most i took from it. Having the player play a simulation without knowing the connection it has to the real world was really interesting.</p>
          <h3>COVID-19 model</h3>
          <p>Basic data mining is fundamentally easy yet practically difficult to achieve. Actual numbers of data is hard to come by due to the unrealistic fact that more or less of the data are updated every second. Collecting data for the coronavirus is such an issue. Data for infection and death are hard to collect due to people not coming out for testing and testing sites dont have enough materials. The article talks a lot abut formulas and other factors about the virus.</p>
