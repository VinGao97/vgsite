      <h1>Documentation</h1>
      <p>For this assignment i incorporated a chart to accompany my stock search functionality. Understanding chart.js is the hard part but using it was super simple. Some things i had difficulty with is implimenting the search with the chart and also appending new data onto the chart when i click search. I had a lot of help from resources such as stackoverflow to help me work around a way to a solution.</p>

      <h1>Readings</h1>
      <h2>Learning From Terminals to Design the Future of User Interfaces</h2>
      <p>This reading talks alot about animations and how applications evolved over time to adapt to new and better languages. They talk about how animations were a great thing to incorporate until you see the same animation over and over again. Developing in terminal is ultimatly the better alternative if you are use to it. To me, terminal is very complicated if you dont know the correct command lines to use. Most modern text editors are used due to their simple UI elements that are made appealing to the user. Terminals are simple and to the point and very plain looking to most and thus arent used as much. </p>
      <h2>The Lost Ancestors of ASCII Art</h2>
      <p>ASCII art has been around for a long time and i never really got into it when i first had a computer. I guess it died down in the early 2000's or i just didnt get a lot of exposure to it. Reading this and looking at the artwork, i'm amazed at how creative these people were to use ASCII to make such interesting artwork. They spend hours on the keyboard to create are, very similar to real life artists practicing their craft and creating new art.</p>
