          <h1>Proposal</h1>
          <p> For the Final project, i wanna do a simulation on population of a country. Some factors that affect the population would be life expectancy, amount of Males to Females, and number of children per women. Factors like ratio between male and female really impact the population throughout the years because if there are no females in the population, the population would eventually die out due to lack of reproduction. For my simulation, i made a simple example on Loopy linked here:
          </p>
          <a href="https://ncase.me/loopy/v1.1/?data=[[[3,984,281,0.83,%22Total%2520Population%22,0],[6,1217,674,0.83,%22Death%22,0],[7,842,102,0.83,%22Births%22,0],[11,774,532,0.83,%22Illness%22,0],[12,455,477,0.83,%22Doctors%22,0]],[[6,3,-200,-1,0],[3,6,-211,1,0],[7,3,-59,1,0],[11,6,-18,1,0],[7,11,-101,1,0],[12,11,24,-1,0],[7,12,-89,1,0],[6,12,195,-1,0],[12,7,280,1,0]],[],12%5D"><h2>Loopy</h2></a>
          <h1>Games Played</h1>
          <h3>The Founder</h3>
            <p>I really enjoyed playing this game. This game really reminds me of game dev tycoon which functions the same way as this browser game. I played for a couple hours but was mostly lost at the beginning stage of the game where i didnt know what products to make or what the functions on the bottom of the game was like. The beginning where you pick your start really impacts the early game experience. I picked a solo start where i had a lot of money and the first product was a bit lacking and slow to produce. Overall i enjoyed this simulation on a corporation and all the features to get the corporation going.</p> 
         <h3>Art Game</h3>
            <p>The art game is really interesting because its essentially a game within a game. A game simulator if you will. You are tasked to create a painting but to make the painting youre forced to play snake. I didnt get past the game and showcase my artwork, i think i didnt reach a certain score in snake to make it a good painting. I really enjoyed the game because its quick and easy to get into. The controls are easy to learn although i would prefer using the space bar instead of the enter key, and the pixel art is pleasing to the eye.</p>
