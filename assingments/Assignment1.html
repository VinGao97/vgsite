                      <p>Websites are an extension of the creator.I agree with Laurel that the website should be about the content the creator wants. The comparison of the major sites like facebook, google and instagram that compromises user experience for advertisements for their own personal interest. Theyre not really looking out for you, only you can look out for yourself. Laurel also mentioned how the website you create can be anything you want. The comparison to a room or a puddle makes sense becuause the room or puddle are very moldable to whatever you want. Just like developing a room or growing a plant, it takes time to fully develop a healthy plant or a well designed room.  </p>
                      <p>Dr.styles talks a lot about the early internet design. It describes a lot of the percieved internet designs and styles were not what the current generation of web designers intended it to be. In my opinion, the styling in that early internet age was very basic and ancient. It is no surprise that many people today didnt expect this and thought there was no progression in how styling in the current era is like. Everything advanced along with styling. The URL during the early ages of the internet had the "~" in every directory. I did not know this and was pleasently surprised. Its something i wouldnt have thought to change but today we dont have any "~" in any of the url. Its mostly used in computer directory. I was also surprised on how primiative web browsers were compared to today. It explained how the web browser back then not only display web pages but its also built as an editor. The user ultimatly became the creator of the webpages being loaded. They were given the option to design font, margins and colors of the site. Both readings emphasised the idea of user interaction and design. Todays mondern era of the internet robbed everyone of that freedom to freely design and change the website unless you know what you were doing.</p>
